# Youtube_Transcription_Pull
*Improved upon original design by hathix/youtube-transcriber*
https://github.com/hathix/youtube-transcriber
My updated version will automate "timedtext" URL extractions using RegEx and Selenium.
This version will also automatically skip video ads so as to not extract ad transcriptions instead of target video transcriptions

Need to transcribe a YouTube video? Turns out that YouTube already makes pretty good automated captions, even though this feature is little known. With this script, you can grab those captions in seconds - so you can, effectively, automatically transcribe your YouTube video!

*Update*
Youtube switched to a JSON transcription output instead of XML. This projects need to be updated...
